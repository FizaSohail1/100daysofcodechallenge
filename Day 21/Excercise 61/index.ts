// Making Enums for Vehicles: Let's create categories for vehicles like cars, trucks, and motorcycles using enums, and show one example.

// making an enum vehicle containing different types
enum vehicles{
    car,
    motorcycle,
    truck
}
//showing one type of vehicle from the list
console.log(vehicles.truck)
//It shows 2 because enums start counting from 0 and according to this the given type truck in on 2 number.
// Here, we're just checking what number the truck category got in our list.
