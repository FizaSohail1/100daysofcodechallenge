// Function Expressions vs. Function Declarations: Compare function expressions and declarations by creating one of each that performs the same task, such as squaring a number.
function squareDeclaration(number) {
    return number * number;

// Function expression for squaring a number
var squareExpression = function (number) {
    return number * number;
};
